Lesson focus: Compass directions, scanning, street crossings at lighted intersections Successful trial: Yes - compass directions Outcomes: Lesson took place in uptown Shelby on sunny day. The student was to follow verbal route directions to complete a route. He successfully utilized compass directions along this route with 3 prompts. He occasionally confused his left/right but often self corrected. The student required prompts to scan for vehicles during travel with 5 prompts. Prompts were mostly given during sidewalk travel, he generally initiated scanning at driveways and alleys without prompting. The student bumped his shoulder into a pole in an unfamiliar, shaded area because he was not sweeping his cane appropriately. Discussed this occurrence with student and reminded him that this occurred because of improper technique. The student was prompted 3 times to position his hand appropriately on the cane. Student completed 6 street crossings with 10 prompts. When given a cue to identify the "street beside him" he identified it correctly 100% of the time. The student required prompts to assist with identifying the surge of parallel traffic, positioning himself appropriately at the street edge when there were no DWT, and cautiously entering the street while scanning. The student has a tendency to bolt into the street without caution. Next lesson: Last lesson of school year.
 
Lesson focus: Street crossing skills Client feedback: "I would like to do some human guide training with my wife if that's all right. She's never gotten any training from the VA or MAB. I also want to be able to work on using the elevator at the VA. I can never seem to find the right buttons. " Outcomes: client practiced street crossings at the intersection of Sharon Amity/Central and Central/Kilbourne. He analyzed both intersections independently and determined crossing risks; the client appropriately elected to cross clockwise rather than counter clockwise. The client aligned himself to cross independently and completed all crossings without veering. COMS worked with client on flagging, which was a new skill for client, and he demonstrated it successfully. The client completed 10 out of 10 crossings independently and located and utilized push button independently. Next lesson: TBD to work on elevator at VA. Direct hours: 17.25/30.
 
Lesson focus: following verbal directions, landmarks/orientation, street crossings. Successful trial: yes - verbal directions. Outcomes: The student was taken off campus for business travel. She was to follow COMS verbal directions to reach the bus station, while making landmarks along the way. Once the student reached the bus station, she was to reverse the route independently to locate the start point. The student followed verbal directions successfully with 1 verbal prompt. She was reminded several times to use landmarks. The student required assistance 3 times to reverse the route, which was an L shape. She completed 6 street crossings at simple lighted intersections. She was prompted 2 times to stand near the edge of the street when waiting to cross so that drivers could identify her intent to cross. She required 4 prompts to identify traffic movements. Using the pedestrian signal, the student identified the appropriate time to initiate a street crossing with 2 prompts. Next lesson: Last lesson of the school year.

Lesson focus: basic cane skills, self-protective techniques Successful trial: no. Outcomes: COMS met this student at her home for lesson. TVI Sara and student’s mother were present. The student reports that she is not feeling better from sinus infection. The student demonstrated upper body protective technique with 1 prompt to place hand away from face. She demonstrated lower body self-protective technique with 4 verbal/physical prompts. The parts of the cane and index finger/pencil grip were reviewed with student. The student was unable to identify parts of the cane; these concepts were retaught. Student demonstrated pencil grip with 3 verbal prompts and index finger grip with 1 verbal prompt. When using index finger grip, the student required 3 prompts to position cane at midline away from abdomen. The student was given 2 at home activities to complete – both were demonstrated and explained to mother, student, TVI and written directions provided. Next lesson: Last lesson of school year.
